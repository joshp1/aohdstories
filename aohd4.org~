* Aohd
  Jason walks into the Kit chen where Aodh is fring egges with a skillet on his wing. 

Jason laughs and says, "So man do you ever go back to hell to chck in?" Aohd nods and flips the pan up. It does a flip and he catches it back on his wing. JAson laughs and says, "WHat was that?" Aohd replies, "It says, you need to flip the
eggs"

Jason replies shaking his head, "Man your supose to flip the egg not the pan and eggs" 

Aohd is amazed and says, "That makes more since. That's probably why I keep burning them"

Jason looks in to the trash and sees it full of burnt black eggs. He looks at Aohd and says, "How many dozen have you used and how did youget them?" 

Aohd shrugs and says, "I don't know but there is some chickens down the road. Why do they swim in water?" Jason laughs andsyas, "Those are geese man" Aohd laughs and says, "That makes more since. I thought they where chckens the somene 
tried to ring the necks but wasn't succeful so they threw them out"

Aohd looks at his wing and says, "Damn I need to go" Jason is busy laughing. 

As Aohd is walking out the front door he stps and says, "Oh crap. He then slams is and runs to the back one. 

Jason is still laughing. Though Aodh is in panick

At the back door Jason opens and sees a very tall ox standing there. His eyes are hollow and he's wearing all black. Aohd tries to leave but he hears. 

"Freeze, Aohd"

Aohd turns around and sees the ox trying to get in but can't. The ox looks at Aohd and says, "Invite me in" Aohd grings and says, "What demon's can't just walk in places? Don't you wish you where neautral like me?" 

The demon angry now says, "Let me in" 

"No"< aohd says mockeingly.

The deemon's eyes begin to glow before he says, "I order you let me in", ina deap hollow voice.

Aohd crosses his wings and shakes his head.
